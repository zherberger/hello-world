# hello-world

Hello Professor! (Do I call you Tom? Elliot says I should. Maybe I should bring this up in person instead of weirdly asking inside a GitHub readme.)

I'm Zachary Herberger! I love studying computer science at Fairmont State. Outside of school my hobbies include baking and listening to lots of techno music.
